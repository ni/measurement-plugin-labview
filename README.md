# Measurement Framework Support for LabVIEW

This repo contains the necessary LabVIEW client/server, template, and examples to call into the Measurement Framework.

## Client

This repo depends on [gRPC Support for LabVIEW](https://github.com/ni/grpc-labview) to generate Discovery Client. The Discovery Client registers measurement services and enumerates previously registered measurement services.

## Server

This repo depends on [gRPC Support for LabVIEW](https://github.com/ni/grpc-labview) to generate the Measurement Server. The Measurement Server enumerates metadata and performs measurements on demand.
