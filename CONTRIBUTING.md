## Getting Started

Procedure to build the repos:

1. All the repo contains a folder called "build spec" which contains a specification file from VIPM.
2. Open the Specification file using VIPM 2020
3. Click Build - Built .vip file will be created in a folder called "build" parallel to "build specs"

## Libraries Maintained in this repo

### Discovery Client

The Discovery Client registers and unregisters the measurement services to the Discovery Service and enumerates previously registered measurement services. All the measurements (service) will be registered to the Discovery Service (statically or dynamically), so that Client application can enumerate them.

This repo is dependent on 1 & 2.1 from above dependency list.

TODO: include the link to build procedure

### Measurement Service Template

This repo contains the Measurement Service template, which has predefined functions to publish the metadata and make measurement operations. This also contains placeholder for measurement developers to add the measurement logic and metadata.

Measurement developers can instantiate a measurement from the template using the "Measurement Instantiation Tool". This repo is dependent on 1, 2.1, 2.2 from above dependency list and the built library of "Discovery Client".

For additional details on measurement service template please refer the [measurements template documentation](source/Measurement%20Service%20Template_lv/README.md)

TODO: include the link to build procedure

### Measurement Instantiation Tool

This repo contains the Script tool to instantiate a measurement from the "Measurement Service Template". This is dependent on 1 and built library of "Measurement Service Template".

TODO: include the link to build procedure
TODO: includes instructions for launching the tool after installation.

### "Measurement Service" Client

This repo contains the client library for the "Measurement Service" that enables communication with the Measurement Service to Get Metadata or Trigger Measurements.

TODO: include the link to build procedure

### Measurement Service Examples

This repo contains example measurement routines developed using the "Measurement Service template". This is dependent on 1, 2.1, 2.2 from above dependency list and the built library of "Discovery Client".

For additional details on examples please refer the [example measurements documentation](source/Example%20Measurements/README.md)
