# Game Of Life

This is a MeasurementLink example that demonstrates the usage of XY Data
in a graph. It allows the user to specify the size of the game board
and the update interval between generations.

It will run indefinitely as long as there are 'births' and 'deaths' happening on the game
board unless the `STOP` button is clicked.

## Features

> **Note**
> Updating the UI while the measurement is running requires MeasurementLink 2023 Q3 or later.
> With older versions of MeasurementLink, this example only updates the UI at the end of the
> measurement.
