# Game Of Life

This is a measurement plug-in example that demonstrates the usage of XY Data
in a graph. It allows the user to specify the size of the game board
and the update interval between generations.

It will run indefinitely as long as there are 'births' and 'deaths' happening on the game
board unless the `STOP` button is clicked.

## Features

- Displays the Game of Life game board in a graph
- Allows the user to cancel the game with the `STOP` button
- Demonstrates how to update the measurement UI while the measurement is running.
